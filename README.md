## Note
This version only parses the newer Hangouts.json format. To parse an older version, use the version in the original repository.

## Features
- Read all hangouts conversations and quickly switch between them.
- It's all JavaScript in one html file! No need to upload your chat history to an unknown source.
- View images inline with thumbnails.
- Emoji support by [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)
- If you have merged Google Voice and Hangouts you will also see your Google Voice conversations.
